### bebop?

[bebop][1] is a small framework for DOM-Manipulation and AJAX.  
It also has support for Promises.

### so?

Backbone uses jQuery per default as tool for DOM-Traversal, Event-Binding and AJAX.  
But I want to use bebop.

---

In the Backbone wiki exists a page which describes what is required to replace jQuery.  
[Using Backbone without jQuery][2]

So this is basically an implementation for [bebop][1]
